# Certificate-Integrity-verificationion

This project implements a blockchain-based certificate management system designed to enhance the integrity, security, and efficiency of educational credential verification. Leveraging Ethereum's blockchain capabilities, it incorporates pre-blockchain encryption using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme to ensure data privacy. The system features a robust architecture with smart contracts, a user-friendly Flask web application, and secure certificate issuance and verification processes. Tested on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, this prototype demonstrates the potential for scalable and tamper-proof educational certificate management while addressing privacy and security challenges. Future enhancements include quantum-resistant cryptography, multi-signature issuance, and cross-chain interoperability.
